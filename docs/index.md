# The PlasticNet Project

PlasticNet is an "IBM Tech for Good" open-source project developed by the IBM Space Tech team to build a repository of AI object detection models to classify types/brands of plastics, trash on beaches, trash in the ocean, etc.

The goals for this project are:

-   Real-time detection of different types of trash (plastic in particular) in the ocean utilizing transfer learning on different machine learning object detection architectures.
-   In the future, we would also like to be able to improve our model to be able to recognize logos/brands on trash, in order to detect and identify which company different types of ocean/beach trash come from
-   To build a fully functional PlasticNet machine learning pipeline that can be easily used to train and test object detection models based from architectures such as YOLOv4, Faster-RCNN, SSD-Resnet, Efficient-DET, Tensorflow, etc. (all accessible inside a command line client)
-   To provide a set of pretrained PlasticNet models that can be utilized for future development and improvement via transfer learning
-   Implement our models to work on real-time satellite and camera footage
