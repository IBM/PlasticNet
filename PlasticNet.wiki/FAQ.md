# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** How can I use PlasticNet on Windows?

**A:** Easy installation and usage is only supported on Mac and Linux. You can run the setup script, but a lot of packages that are necessary for TensorFlow will fail to install due to them not being supported on Windows pip. There are workarounds you can find on Google (if you look up how to install Pycocotools on windows and the TensorFlow Object Detection API on Windows). If you are able to get those installed, you should be able to use the rest of PlasticNet fine. YOLO appears to work on Windows also, but if you find any errors, we recommend looking at the [YOLO Repository README](https://github.com/mattokc35/darknet#yolov4-darknet--ibm-plasticnet-spacetech) to find more information about a Windows Installation. 

If you wish to use PlasticNet on Windows, we recommend you follow the instructions on the "How to use PlasticNet without the CLI" Wiki page, and when a step doesn't work, find a workaround on Google. Most of these projects are built for UNIX-based systems, so getting them up and running on Windows will be challenging.
